export const bioContent = 'Originally from Orange County, California, I graduated magna cum laude from Chapman University with a Bachelor of Arts in Film Studies. I found my footing in the world of production at Lakeshore Entertainment, where I spent eight years learning the craft of filmmaking. But as the world shifted and changed, so too did my interests, turning towards the creation of short-form content, including celebrity interviews and hosted video, branded content, commercials, and music videos. Through it all, I have adapted to the ever-evolving content consumption habits of audiences, adding new format deliverables to meet their needs. I enjoy collaborating with creative individuals and production crew teams to deliver high-quality products according to each brand\'s voice.'
